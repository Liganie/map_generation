Need a way to make some mountains bigger while remaining in the mountain areas
Need a way to generate a map that is not dependent on the grid
	Need to get ouly the contours of the coasts / biomes and work from there
	This would alow more control over size / density
	This would allow to set a level of details as well
	This would require to be able to set a random point in a complex shape
		Need to create a new grid from the shape
		Need probabilities equals to the area of the triangle
Re organize everything
	features
		cities
		mountains
		rivers
		borders
	terrain
		coast
		terrain itself
City name change at each show/hide cities
	this could be a feature
	or this could be fixed through the handling of the seeded generator
Try different type of generator for names
	Add different prefix or suffix to names depending on the culture (dungon/fort for instance)
	Potentially add a generator using adjectives / name like ironhaven or sandcity
Try different type of generator for terrain
	using polygons
	using noise
	potentially different sampling for the coasts
Add posibility to change water, terrain, biome and elevevation color, potentially per region
	possiblity to edit the color in a dedicated window
possibility to change texture and renderings
Change the city creation to contain more city types
Change the city generation to be population / region based instead of capital based
Change the region generation to be of different sizes or contain more than one big city (but only one capital)
Try to be able to hide paramter window in a foldable fashion
Fix the terrain generator to be able to used multiple time the same elements
Add lakes
Add different cultures into the game, one per region at max

long term:
	possibility to drag and drop cities or other feature unto the map
	possibility to edit the map
