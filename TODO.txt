Prio 1
	biomes

Coast shading -> through outline
City name change at each show/hide cities
	this could be a feature
	or this could be fixed through the handling of the seeded generator
Code should be made using proper import for clean dependecies if possible
Code should be better separated
	grid generation
	terrain generation
	citites generation
	rendering
Try different type of generator
	Add different prefix or suffix to names depending on the culture (dungon/fort for instance)
	Potentially add a generator using adjectives / name like ironhaven or sandcity
Try different type of generator
	using polygons
	using noise
	potentially different sampling for the coasts
Add biomes to the mix
	Potentially based on a wind model
	Base on slopes
		beaches close to the sea
		flat terrain will be plains
		"plant" trees in plain and see them grow depending on water and random spread
Add posibility to change water, terrain, biome and elevevation color, potentially per region
	possiblity to edit the color in a dedicated windoz
possibility to change texdture and renderings
Add the posibility to change to different colors schemes
Change the city creation to contain more city types
Change the city generation to be population / region based instead of capital based
Change the region generation to be of different sizes or contain more than one big city (but only one capital)
Try to be able to hide paramter window in a foldable fashion
Create a layout closer to a proper webpage
	generate different subpage to test the different components independently
		Index shall be for random map only
		Page for grid generation?
		Page for terrain only generation
		Page for cities placement
		Page for biomes testing
Fix the terrain generator to be able to used multiple time the same elements
Add lakes
Makes rivers grow bigger as they get longer
Add different cultures into the game, one per region

long term:
	possibility to drag and drop cities or other feature unto the map
	possibility to edit the map
